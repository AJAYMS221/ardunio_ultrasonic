# arduino_ultrasonic
An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures distance by using ultrasonic sound waves. It emits a high-frequency sound pulse (usually 40 kHz) through its trigger pin, and when the sound wave reflects back from an object, the sensor’s echo pin detects it.By calculating the time taken for the echo to return, the distance to the object can be measured.

Working Principle:

Distance = (Speed of Sound × Time) / 2 (divided by 2 because the sound travels to the object and back)

Common Module: HC-SR04

Range: 2 cm – 400 cm
